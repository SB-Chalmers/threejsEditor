This is a web-based 3D building design tool developed for teaching and exploring
computational sustainable design and urban building energy modelling.


The tool allows users to create and modify simple building models, work with
surrounding context, explore different design options, and study things such as
solar position and shadows. The intention is to give students a hands-on way of
seeing how changes to a building affect the design and its surrounding environment.

The application is built with React, TypeScript and Three.js, with D3.js used for
design exploration and Rhino3dm used for working with `.3dm` geometry.


## Features

### 3D Building Design
![alt text](image.png)
- Draw building footprints directly in the 3D view
- Extrude footprints into buildings
- Change the number and height of floors
- Generate and configure windows
- Change building materials and colours
- Edit buildings interactively in the scene

### 3D View
![alt text](image-1.png)
- Real-time Three.js rendering
- Perspective and orthographic camera views
- Camera navigation and controls
- Optional grid
- Snap-to-grid
- Dynamic lighting and shadows
- Dark and light themes

### Context Models

HEATH can be used together with surrounding building geometry to provide
context for the design.

- Import `.3dm` models
- Work with surrounding buildings
- Use grid and snapping when positioning geometry

### Sun and Shadow Analysis

The sun controller provides a simple way of exploring how the sun moves
around a building and how this affects shadows.

This is intended primarily as a visual and educational tool for investigating
orientation, massing and surrounding context.

### Design Exploration
![alt text](image-2.png)
The design exploration tools allow different building configurations to be
created and compared.

Design alternatives are represented as a graph, making it possible to see how
one design develops into another and return to earlier configurations.

D3.js is used for the graph visualisation.

## Creating a Building
![alt text](image-3.png)
1. Select the drawing tool.
2. Click on the ground plane to place the building corners.
3. Right-click to finish the footprint.
4. Open the building configuration.
5. Adjust the number of floors, floor height, windows and materials.
6. Continue editing the building or create another design variation.

## Design Exploration

The design exploration tools are used to investigate different versions of a
building.

A design can be changed and saved as a new configuration, allowing different
options to be compared. The design graph shows the relationship between the
different configurations and can be used to return to an earlier version.

The exact performance metrics and analysis tools are still under development.

## Project Structure

The main parts of the application are organised roughly as follows:

### Core

* `ThreeJSCore` — central Three.js setup
* `CameraManager` — camera and navigation
* `SceneManager` — scene and object management
* `LightingManager` — lighting and shadows
* `EnvironmentManager` — ground, sky and environment

### Services

* `BuildingService` — building creation and modification
* `DrawingService` — drawing and geometry creation
* `WindowService` — window generation
* `DesignExplorationService` — design variations and exploration

### Components

* `SimpleBuildingCreator` — main application
* `LeftToolbar` — main design tools
* `BottomToolbar` — viewport controls
* `BuildingConfigPanel` — building settings
* `SunController` — sun and shadow controls

## About HEATH

HEATH is being developed as part of teaching and research around sustainable
built environments and computational design.

The web tool is intended to make it easier for students to experiment with
building design and understand the connection between geometry, context and
environmental performance.

The project is under active development, so parts of the application and
documentation may change.
